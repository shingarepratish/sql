TOP, MIN & MAX
1)
Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
ANS QUERY)-
select Round(max(LAT_N),4) from STATION where LAT_N < 137.2345;
2)
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
ANS QUREY)-
select Round(LONG_W,4) from  STATION where LAT_N = (Select Max(LAT_N)from STATION where LAT_N < 137.2345);
3)
Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
ANS QUERY)-
select Round(min(LAT_N),4) from STATION where LAT_N > 38.7780;
4)
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
ANS QUERY)-
select Round(LONG_W,4) from STATION where LAT_N = (select MIN(LAT_N) from STATION where LAT_N > 38.7780);
5)
Consider P1(a, b) and P2(c, d) to be two points on a 2D plane.
 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
ANS QUERY)-select Round(ABS(MIN(LAT_N) - MAX(LAT_N)) + ABS(MIN(LONG_W) - MAX(LONG_W)),4) FROM STATION;
